## Biography

Curtis is a systems guy with a wild card core.  
He’s spent years in the IT world, transitioned into nonprofit impact, and now operates at the intersection of tactical execution and long-game thinking.

He can map out a sales flow, tear down a flawed incentive model, or get philosophical about AGI—all without breaking stride.

Legacy matters to him—but only if it’s earned.  
He’s not here to talk about what’s been done.  
He’s here to make sure what comes next actually works.
